# Convolutional autoencoder simulator for reconstruct and find the vertex of decay's sub atomic particles from high energy physics 

The simulation consist in three phases, where it has tried each phase would have algorithms properly used, it has included machine learning (like as hierarchical clustering) and autoencoder combined with convolutional neural networks (and deep learning). The main approach is to simulate the start-up of MATHUSLA project with programming tools of high level and data sciences techniques.

So, what is MATHUSLA and what is the phases proposed?

## MATHUSLA experiment.

MATHUSLA (Massive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra Stable neutraL pArticles) is a proposed detector at CERN with the aim of going online with the HL-LHC upgrade to the Large Hadron Collider in ~2025.
